            <p>
                I am the founder and creator of 3LineOfCode, a website that I named after my experience of finding simple solutions to complex problems. I chose this name because more often than not, I find that the code needed to solve a particular issue is much simpler than I initially thought, and can be accomplished in just a few lines of code. With my website, I aim to share my knowledge and help others find simple solutions to their coding problems, regardless of their experience level. I am passionate about web development, mobile app development, content writing, SEO, and digital marketing, and I strive to offer the best possible services to my clients.
